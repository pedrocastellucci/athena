Even when considered as independent from the other ones, each of the mentioned problems is of large combinatorial complexity. This research aims to allow companies to increase the value added by their perishable goods in supply chains through a combination of production and distribution planning on a multi-objective framework solved by hybrid solution approaches.

The evaluation criteria were: the minimization of the total elapsed time; the maximization of the average percentage of working time; and the minimization of the average time in the system. Findings – The increasing mean operation times line arrangement is superior to the decreasing mean operation times line arrangement for the normal and exponential distributions and the variances equal to 1 and 16, in terms of the total elapsed time and the average percentage of the working time evaluation criteria. The decreasing mean operation times lines is marginally superior to the increasing operation times line for the normal distribution for the variances equal to 1 and 16, in terms of the average time in the system evaluation criterion. The above inference can be made for the exponential distribution for the variance 16, but no definitive conclusion can be made for the variance 1.

      "abstract = {The bowl phenomenon provides a way of increasing the throughput of some production line systems with variable processing times by purposely unbalancing the line in a certain manner. However, achieving this increase in throughput depends on correctly identifying the values of the system parameters to estimate the optimal amount of unbalance and then actually being able to assign work to stations according to the optimal bowl allocation. In this paper we study the robustness of the bowl phenomenon by examining the effect of inaccurately estimating the optimal amount of unbalance and the effect of deviating from the optimal bowl allocation. Our results show that the bowl phenomenon is relatively robust in the sense that fairly large errors (even 50\\%) in the amount of unbalance still provide most of the potential improvement in throughput over a perfectly balanced line. Moreover, the throughput still exceeds that of a perfectly balanced line in most cases even when the work allocation to each station deviates from the optimal bowl allocation by as much as 10\\%. We also address the question of whether the optimal bowl allocation or the balanced line provides a more robust 'target' when assigning work to stations. When the deviations from these two targets are of the same magnitude, we found that the optimal bowl allocation target yields the larger throughput in most cases, where the average difference between their throughputs is roughly the same as the difference between the optimal throughput and the throughput of a balanced line. Furthermore, for the same magnitude of deviation, the throughput depends more heavily on the direction of the deviation from the balanced line than that from the optimal bowl allocation, so that the risk of a substantially reduced throughput is much larger when using the balanced line as the target. Therefore, the optimal bowl allocation provides a much more robust target than the balanced line. Keywords:},\n",

      "abstract = {This paper provides results related to the optimal design of unpaced production lines. It has been shown previously that unbalancing an unpaced production line in an appropriate way will increase its production rate. Results are presented here which show how the optimal allocation of work between stations changes with respect to — the number of work stations in the line, — the limit on the amount of work-in-progress, and — the variance of station operation times. An analysis of results given here demonstrate the following system characteristics. When the number of stations in the production line increases, the average amount of unbalance in the optimal allocation remains about the same, but the increase in mean production rate obtained by using the optimal allocation rather than the balanced line becomes substantially larger. If the operation times are highly variable (exponential distribution), the effect of increasing in-process storage space is to substantially decrease the average amount of unbalance in the optimal allocation but to only slightly decrease the resulting improvement over the balanced line. If the amount of in-process storage space is very small, the effect of decreasing the variability of operation times is to decrease these same quantities but at a surprisingly slow rate. On the other hand, the effect of simultaneously increasing in-process storage space and decreasing the variability of operation times is to very rapidly decrease both the optimal unbalance and the resulting improvement. The model used to characterize an unpaced production line system is the classical queueing system with finite queues in series.},\n",

      "abstract = {In the present fierce global competition, poor responsiveness, low flexibility to meet the uncertainty of demand, and the low efficiency of traditional assembly lines are adequate motives to persuade manufacturers to adopt highly flexible production tools such as cross-trained workers who move along the assembly line while carrying out their planned jobs at different stations [1]. Cross-trained workers can be applied in various models in assembly lines. A novel model which taken into consideration in many industries nowadays is called the linear walking worker assembly line and employs workers who travel along the line and fully assemble the product from beginning to end [2]. However, these flexible assembly lines consistently endure imbalance in their stations which causes a significant loss in the efficiency of the lines. The operational time variability is one of the main sources of this imbalance [3] and is the focus of this study which investigated the possibility of decreasing the mentioned loss by arranging workers with different variability in a special order in walking worker assembly lines. The problem motivation comes from the literature of unbalanced lines which is focused on bowl phenomenon. Hillier and Boling [4] indicated that unbalancing a line in a bowl shape could reach the optimal production rate and called it bowl phenomenon. This study chose a conceptual design proposed by a local automotive company as a case study and a discrete event simulation study as the research method to inspect the questions and hypotheses of this research. The results showed an improvement of about 2.4\\% in the throughput due to arranging workers in a specific order, which is significant compared to the fixed line one which had 1 to 2 percent improvement. In addition, analysis of the results concluded that having the most improvement requires grouping all low skill workers together. However, the pattern of imbalance is significantly effective in this improvement concerning validity and magnitude. Keywords:},\n",

Another case that is considered in this study is the failures of conveyers which happen in the real world and the fatigue of operators is considered too.

Second, the output of the optimizer is used to implement a simulation model in Visual Slam. Third, after running the model in simulator, the desired outputs are evaluated and the necessary changes will be made to optimizer parameters.

Whenever real-world data is lacking, generated data sets provide a substantive methodological tool for experiments. Focused research questions need to base on special- ized, randomized and sufficiently large data sets, which are sampled from the population of interest. We integrate the generation of data sets into the process of scientific testing. Until now, no appropriate generators or systematic data sets have been available for the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP). Computational experiments were mostly based on very limited data sets unsystematically collected from the literature and from some real-world cases. As a consequence, former performance analyses often come to contradictory conclusions and lack on statistical evidence. We introduce SALBPGen, a new instance generator for the simple ALBP which can be applied and extended to any generalized ALBP, too. Unlike most generators, SALBPGen takes into account usual prop- erties of precedence graphs in manufacturing. It is very flexible and able to create instances with very diverse structures under full control of the experiment’s designer. We also propose new challenging data sets, as shown with the new direct measure of instance’s hardness called trickiness. By two exemplary computational experiments, we illustrate how important insights can be gained with the help of the systematically generated data sets.},\n",

For the exponential service times assumed at one of the stages, the set of simultaneous equations satisfied by the steady-state probabilities are shown to involve the Laplace transform of the density function at the other stage and its various order derivatives. An analysis of this set of equations leads to a recursive solution for the mean production rate of a system with any number of storages. The realistic cases of Erlang and normal density functions are worked out in detail. It turns out that for moderate coefficients of variation the production rates for these two distributions differ only marginally. That this is not generally true is illustrated by considering a uniform distribution, for which the results are significantly different.

While such a result is valid for production systems with otherwise identical stages, earlier studies have suggested that a different effect may come into play when the stages of the system differ in their variability. In the simplest case of n two-stage system, production rate could be improved by shifting a part of the work load from the more variable stage to the less variable one. From an analysis of three-stage systems with all possible combinations of exponential and deterministic stages, it is shown in the present paper that optimum unbalancing results from a superposition of these two effects. This loads in some cases to a large improvement in the production rate. For the large differences in coefficients of variation considered in this paper, the ' variability imbalance ' clearly plays a decisive role and outweighs the ' bowl phenomenon ' when they act in opposing directions. For a three-stage system with a uniform stage sandwiched between two exponential stages, it is shown that the two effects exactly cancel one another when the coefficient of variation of the central stage is nearly 05.},\n",

      "abstract = {In this paper we study the operating behaviour and performance of reliable, unpaced and unbalanced serial production lines with either imbalanced service time means, unequal coefficients of variation, or uneven buffer capacities. The lines were simulated with various values of line length, buffer storage size, degree of imbalance, coefficient of variation, along with a number of imbalance configurations. The primary measures of efficiency were idle time and average buffer level. Output data from the discrete event simulation of such lines under their steady-state mode of operation were analyzed using a set of statistical methods. Various relationships between the independent and response variables, rankings of configurations and comparisons with balanced lines were obtained. For the mean processing times imbalance, it turned out that a bowl-shaped arrangement provides smaller idle time amounts and lower average buffer levels than those of a balanced line counterpart. As regards the variability imbalance, it was found that the best configurations are respectively, a bowl allocation and a monotone decreasing order, with the first resulting in decreased idle times and the second leading to lower average buffer levels than those of a balanced line. As far as the buffer size imbalance is concerned, it was concluded that the most advantageous patterns that generate lower idle times and average buffer levels as compared to a balanced line are to respectively distribute total available buffer capacity as evenly as possible along the buffers and to allocate more buffer capacity towards the end of the line.},\n",

The first segment provtded a comprehensive review of previously published research on unpaced assembly lines. Two of the primary references in this review were path-breaking studies by Hillier and Bohng (1966) and Hillier and Bohng (1979). These studies introduced the idea of the \"bowl phenomenon,\" which suggests that line output can be increased (compared to a balanced line) by unbalancing the line with high service times placed at the beginning and end of the line and low service times placed in the middle of the line. This pair of studies also verified the existence of the bowl phenomenon for exponential and Erlang service times with line lengths up to five stations and buffer capacities between stations from zero to four units.},\n",

      "abstract = {Previous design studies of unpaced assembly lines that exhibit stochastic task times indicate that an unbalanced allocation of task times results in optimal output rates. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the previous literature on this topic and discuss the results of simulation experiments that test the bowl distribution for unbalancing unpaced lines. The simulation experiment was designed to test the bowl distribution in more realistic environments than previously tested and illustrates that a balanced line configuration is as good as or better than an unbalanced line configuration when task times are modeled with more typical values of variance. Stochastic unpaced assembly line research employs both simulation and analytical approaches to test the allocation of buffer capacity and task times to work stations. Analytical models are utilized to investigate simple line designs with exponential or Erlang task time distributions. Simulation is used for longer lines and for normal task time distributions. From the review of the previous research using both approaches, we note five major findings: 1) unbalancing task time allocation is optimal when task time variation is large; 2) unbalanced allocation of buffer storage capacity improves line output rate when task time variation is large; 3) output rate of an unpaced line decreases as the number of sequential workstations increases; 4) output rate increases as more buffer storage capacity is available; and 5) output rate decreases as the task time variation increases. Most of the previous research on unpaced lines investigated lines with few workstations and large task time variation. Empirical research by Dudley (6) suggests that variation of task times in practice is much less than variations employed in previous unpaced line studies. We present the results from simulation experiments that model longer unpaced lines with lower levels of task time variance of the magnitude that is likely to occur in practice. The results of our simulation experiments verify the benefits of using the bowl distribution for task time allocation when line lengths are short and task times experience large variance. However, when line lengths are extended or task time variation is reduced, the use of the bowl distribution for unbalancing the line degrades the line's efficiency. In these situations, the optimal task time allocation is a balanced line. Two important implications for managers follow from the results of our experiments: 1) that unpaced line output rate is relatively insensitive to moderate variations from optimal task time allocations when buffer storage is limited; and 2) that perfectly balanced line designs are optimal for most cases in practice.},\n",

A recent simulation study suggests that unbalancing the production line may not improve the efficiency of the line when the processing times are normally distributed. However, it appears that the unbalanced work allocation being studied may not be chosen appropriately in the simulation study and therefore, no significant improvement (and actually a decrease) in performance was observed when compared with the perfectly balanced work allocation. This study performs a similar set of simulation experiments of the previous study with normally distributed processing times, but uses more appropriate unbalanced work allocations to determine whether the efficiency of a production line can be improved if the line is unbalanced appropriately.},\n",
